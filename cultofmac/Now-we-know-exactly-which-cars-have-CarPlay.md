标题：现在我们知道究竟哪些汽车拥有CarPlay

Apple’s finally getting specific about how well adoption of its CarPlay protocol is going.

苹果的特定推广使其CarPlay协议正在被广泛接受。

A list appeared on the company’s website today confirming that over half of the manufacturers it has partnered with have announced specific models of vehicles that will receive the functionality.

今天其公司官网出现的一份列表，这证实了有超过一半与其合作的厂商宣布了将要采用这个功能的具体车辆型号。

If you’re wondering which cars have CarPlay, you have over a hundred to choose from. Here’s what we know so far.

如果你想知道哪些汽车支持CarPlay，你有超过100种选择。这是到目前为止我们所知道的。

CarPlay lets drivers connect their iPhones to their vehicles and then run certain functions through in-dash displays. In addition to making phone calls, CarPlay also supports Music, Apple’s Podcast app, and a variety of third-party music and radio players like Spotify and iHeartRadio.

CarPlay帮助驾驶者将他们的iPhone与车辆连接，然后通过车辆内置的显示器启动某些功能。除了打电话之外，CarPlay也支持音乐，苹果自家的Podcast，还有像Spotify和iHeartRadio等种类繁多的第三方音乐和收音机播放器。

Below is the list from the official Apple site, as of this writing. It includes 104 individual models from 21 automakers. Click on the image to see it full-size:

Volkswagen and Chevrolet are the big players with a combined 32 vehicles. But despite its enthusiasm, Volkswagen had some drama at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas last week when it said Apple wouldn’t let it show off its cars’ wireless functionality with CarPlay. That seemed a little confusing at the time, since we aren’t sure why Apple wouldn’t want anyone showing off how cool the feature is, especially cord-free. But we assume that the iPhone maker wants to control the flow of news, starting with this list.

大众和雪佛兰作为重量级选手加在一起有32种车型。但尽管如此热情，上周在拉斯维加斯举办的CES展会上，大众有一出戏码，其表示苹果不让其通过CarPlay展示车辆的无线功能。这看起来多少让人有点不解，因为我们不确信苹果为什么不想让任何人展示CarPlay如此COOL的特性，尤其是cord-free（还不知道此为何物）。但我们假设iPhone的制造者想要控制这些新闻，让人们从这份列表开始。

That leaves 19 other partners like BMW, Alfa Romeo, and Toyota who haven’t announced their CarPlay-compatible vehicles yet, but that isn’t to say they won’t have any. It’s possible they’re working out some technical issues or simply haven’t shown their cars off yet. Still, Apple’s showing 50 percent with its deals, and that’s not bad at all.

像BMW，Alfa Romeo和Toyota等另外19个合作伙伴并没有宣布他们的车辆对CarPlay的兼容情况，但这并不意味着他们没有。他们可能正在解决一些技术问题或者只是单纯的不想炫耀他们的车而已。尽管如此，苹果展示了50%，这也不错了。

If you’re holding out for your favorite make(译者注:这里是否应该是maker?) or model, you don’t have to worry if it never shows. Apple is also partnering with stereo companies Alpine, Kenwood, and Pioneer to make after-market kits available for drivers whose cars don’t come with the feature.

如果你坚持你所喜爱的制造商或者车型，你不必担心他们不推出。苹果也与Alpine，Kenwood和Pioneer合作制造可用于那些不支持CarPlay车型的后市配套组件。
